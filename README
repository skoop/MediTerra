What is it?
===========

External libraries
==================
MediTerra uses external libraries to ensure the wheel isn't reinvented.

For interfacing with Azure Storage, MediTerra uses the PHPAzure library (http://phpazure.codeplex.com/). This library has a specific license, which can be found in lib/vendor/PHPAZURE-LICENSE.txt
