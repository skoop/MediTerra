What is it?
===========

MediTerra is an application that will help you manage your Windows Azure Storage. With MediTerra, you will be able to easily list, add, show, edit and delete Azure Storage entries. 

MediTerra is the entry of Stefan Koopmanschap into the European WinPHP Challenge. Read the announcement of the project at http://www.leftontheweb.com/message/introducing_mediterra

External libraries
==================
MediTerra uses external libraries to ensure the wheel isn't reinvented.

For interfacing with Azure Storage, MediTerra uses the PHPAzure library (http://phpazure.codeplex.com/). This library has a specific license, which can be found in lib/vendor/PHPAZURE-LICENSE.txt

For request and response handling as well as event dispatching, MediTerra uses the libraries of symfony 1.4. These libraries are also released under the MIT license (like MediTerra) but a seperate lib/vendor/SYMFONY-LICENSE.txt has been included for clarity.

For templating, MediTerra uses the Twig library (http://www.twig-project.org/). The license for Twig can be found in lib/vendor/TWIG-LICENSE.txt.

Iconset

The iconset used is the Famfamfam Silk iconset (http://www.famfamfam.com/lab/icons/silk/), which is available under the Creative Commons Attribution 2.5 License.
